General application notes:
Uses internal LDO to provide 5V VCC pin
TI recommneds adding a Schottky in series with the VIN pin to prevent reverse current flow out from VOUT to VIN 
t_p is the oscillator period 
t_off is the minimum off time, typically 90 ns
Once VCC voltage exceeds 3v3 and EN pin is connected to a  >1V source, the soft start sequence begins
Output remains active unless the VCC voltage falls below 3.1V or EN is low 
Normally, VDDA is 5V except when in PFM mode with a light or no load on output then it goes to 3v3
Can set the output to 3v3 by connecting FB to VDDA
Can set output to 5V or 12V by installing 24.9k or 49.9k between FB and VDDA


Components:
Rt = 10k -> ~1988 kHz switching frequency
Ceramic cap from VCC to PGND -> recommended value b/w 2.2 and 10 uF
Bypass VDDA with a 100nF or higher ceramic to reduce rail noise 
Tie VCCX to GND
Enable resistor divider 1k & 40k provides enable with around a 1.4V input
worry about pgood later
