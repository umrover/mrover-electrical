Michigan Mars Rover Team

Hello and Welcome to the Controls and Data Handling (now called Embedded Hardware) git hub repository!


For a brief intro to git, installing gitbash, and using gitbash go to this link:

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control



The gist of this repo is to keep all board designs you may work on in one neat place and to keep track of each change made to the board.
This way there really should be no reason for you to have multiple different copies stored locally on your computer! So please use this
resource religiously!! Also this will allow others to see what you've worked on in order to learn and perhaps even improve upon others
designs. Finally it's just best that you start learning git and version control as git is used by hundreds of companies to perform
version control, and you will no doubt encounter git in your classes here at Michigan!! So happy committing, Go Blue, and Rover all Over!!!


GOOD GIT ETIQUETTE:
1. Make sure you always use the command "git pull" before you begin working on a project to make sure you are using the latest version
2. Make sure you create a separate folder for each and every project you work on. There should never be lonely files on the main page of the repository
3. Always add relevant commit messages! Nothing too long, but descriptive enough that people know what you did.
4. NEVER KEEP UNPUSHED MATERIAL ON YOUR LOCAL COMPUTER
5. ALWAYS PUSH BEFORE YOU STOP WORKING 
6. Have Fun!
