\section{Project Summary}
The Canalyzer project seeks to recreate the viewer functionality from the Vector
Canalyzer tool.  It will have a microcontroller connected to a LCD to display all of
the messages which are sent over the CAN bus connected to the board.  There should be
at least one set of two molex microfit 4 pin connectors for can input and passthrough.
Support power delivery from 5V wall wart (DC barrel jack in), ideally keep power draw 
$<1$A but $<2$A is satisfactory.  3D print a case for the final product.

\section{Project Extensions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Another separate set with its own transciever can be added as DNP in case we eventually
require two separate CAN busses in the future, but that is not strictly necessary.
\item Add support for sending test messages with an adjustable CAN ID (encoder knob perhaps).
\end{itemize}
